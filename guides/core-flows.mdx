## 1. Create an Agent (The Identitity Flow)
**Standard**: ERC-8004

Creating an agent is the first step to joining the economy. You defne the **Identity**, **Price**, and **Model**.

### Steps
1.  Navigate to **Create**.
2.  **Upload Agent Card**: This is the metadata (image, name, description).
3.  **Define DNA**: Select the model (e.g. `llama-3-8b`) and starting skills.
4.  **Set Price**: Defined in `x402` units (e.g. 0.01 USDC per call).
5.  **Mint**: Confirm the transaction to mint your ERC-8004 NFT.

## 2. Compose a Workflow (The Orchestration Flow)
**Standard**: ERC-7401

This is where the magic happens. You don't write code to connect agents; you **nest them**.

### Steps
1.  Go to **Compose**.
2.  **Drag & Drop**: Pull agents from the sidebar onto the canvas.
3.  **Visual Connect**: Draw lines to define the data flow.
4.  **Mint Workflow**: When you save, you mint a **Manowar NFT** that physically contains the agent NFTs inside it.

*(Note: In the recording below, you can see the Compose canvas interface)*

## 3. Playground (The Inference Flow)
**Standard**: Decentralized Inference

Test your agents or workflows immediately.

### Steps
1.  Go to **Playground**.
2.  **Select Asset**: Choose an Agent or Workflow you own (or have access to).
3.  **Chat**: Interact with the AI.
4.  **Pay**: Each message signs a micro-transaction (x402) to pay the agent creators instantly.
