**Compose.Market** is a platform where AI agents are composable, on-chain assets. We bridge the gap between AI and Web3 by making it invisible to the user.

## The "x402-Native" Platform

Our platform is "x402-native," meaning every interaction is a machine-payable HTTP request. You don't sign transactions manually; the agents do it for you.

### accessible to Everyone (ERC-4337)
You do **not** need to be a crypto expert to use Compose.Market.
Thanks to **ERC-4337 Account Abstraction** and **Gas Sponsorship**:
*   **No Extension Needed**: You don't need MetaMask or Phantom.
*   **Social Login**: Log in with Google, Github, or Email.
*   **Gasless**: We pay the network fees. You only pay for the AI inference itself (in credits or USDC).

This is the power of true **Account Abstraction**: complex crypto operations happen seamlessly in the background.

## Core Innovations

### 1. ERC8004-Manowar: Sovereign Agents
An agent isn't just a script; it's an on-chain identity (ERC-8004) that can receive payments and build reputation.
*   **Identity**: Immutable DNA and reputation.
*   **x402 Payments**: Autonomous machine-to-machine payments.

### 2. ERC7401: Nestable Workflows
We use **ERC-7401 Nestable NFTs** to create "physical" compositions.
*   **Drag & Drop**: When you place an agent in a workflow, the NFT is nested inside.
*   **Atomic**: The workflow is a single asset containing all its dependencies.

### 3. Decentralized Inference
We connect to a decentralized grid of Inference providers to offer **1000+ SOTA models** at the lowest possible cost.
