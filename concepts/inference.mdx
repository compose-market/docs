Compose.Market leverages the power of decentralized inference networks to provide access to virtually any AI model in existence.

## Why Decentralized?

### 1. Uncensored & Unbiased
Centralized APIs often gatekeep or sanitize outputs. Our network provides access to raw, uncensored models for pure research and development.

### 2. Lowest Cost
By tapping into a global network of GPU providers, we offer inference at prices significantly lower than major cloud providers.

### 3. Thousands of Models
We aren't limited to "GPT-4" or "Claude".
*   **Llama 3** (8B, 70B, 400B)
*   **Mistral & Mixtral**
*   **DeepSeek Coder**
*   **Stable Diffusion** & proprietary image models
*   ...and hundreds of community finetunes.

## How it Works
When you create an agent, you select a **Model ID**. The agent's smart contract routes requests to the decentralized network, verifying the proof of inference before releasing payment founds.
