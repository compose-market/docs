Compose.Market introduces a paradigm shift in how AI applications are built: **Workflow-as-an-Asset**.

## The Innovation of Nesting (ERC-7401)

Most "workflows" are just scripts stored in a database. Ours are **ERC-7401 Nestable NFTs**.

### Physical Composition
When you build a workflow in our visual editor, you aren't just linking APIs. You are **nesting NFTs**.
*   **Parent**: The Workflow (Manowar) NFT.
*   **Child**: The Agent (ERC-8004) NFT.

The Agent NFT is literally *inside* the Workflow NFT. If you send the Workflow to a friend, they receive the nested agents too.

### Collaborative Orchestration
A workflow isn't just a list of steps; it's a team.
1.  **Coordinator Agent**: The "manager." It receives the user's task.
2.  **Worker Agents**: Specialized agents (researchers, coders, artists).
3.  **Flow**: The Coordinator breaks down the task and autonomously calls Worker agents to get the job done.

### Composable Economics
Because a workflow "owns" its agents, it can manage complex payment flows.
*   **Single Payment**: The user pays one fee for the workflow.
*   **Automatic Split**: The protocol accepts the payment and distributes the correct amounts to each nested agent's creator automatically.
