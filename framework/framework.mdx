title: 'Manowar Agentic Execution'
description: 'The compose.market Orchestration Framework'
---

Manowar is a production-grade orchestration framework designed for **fully autonomous, continuous workflows**. It coordinates specialized agents through a unified execution loop with integrated observability, memory management, and context window optimization.

## Architectural Overview

The framework consists of three main layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Execution Layer"
        O[ManowarOrchestrator] --> P[TaskPlanner]
        O --> D[delegation.ts]
        P --> R[Reflection Loop]
    end
    
    subgraph "Observability Layer"
        O --> L[LangSmithTokenTracker]
        O --> C[checkpoint.ts]
        O --> RT[run-tracker.ts]
    end
    
    subgraph "Memory Layer"
        O --> M[Mem0 via memory.ts]
        O --> E[embeddings.ts]
        O --> CTX[ContextWindowManager]
    end
```

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialize**: Fetch `manowarCard` from IPFS, build coordinator system prompt
2. **Plan**: `TaskPlanner` decomposes goal into atomic steps with dependencies
3. **Execute**: Delegate each step to specialized agents via HTTP
4. **Track**: Record token usage, checkpoints, and metrics
5. **Reflect**: Evaluate quality and adjust plan if needed
6. **Persist**: Store learnings and complete run tracking

# The Thing, Not the Tool

Manowar is an **execution factory** that turns user goals into coordinated multi-agent operations. Tools require human operation; Manowar operates autonomously once deployed.

## From Tooling to Agency

| Traditional AI Tools | Manowar Agentic System |
| --- | --- |
| User issues prompts | User defines goals |
| AI suggests actions | System executes workflows |
| Human validates each step | Agents validate each other |
| Session-bound context | Persistent cross-run memory |
| Pay for capacity | Pay for outcomes |

## The Manowar Identity

A **Manowar** is a deployable workflow NFT—an on-chain entity with:

- **Embedded Agent Cards**: Component agents with specific skills, models, and plugins
- **Execution Graph**: Directed edges defining agent collaboration order
- **Coordinator Model**: A reasoning-optimized LLM (Nemotron, Kimi K2, MiniMax M2.1, …) orchestrating all operations
- **Derived Wallet**: Cryptographic identity for on-chain settlement and memory addressing

```

├── coordinator        # { model: "minimax/minimax-m2.1", hasCoordinator: true }
└── walletAddress      # Primary identifier: 0x...
```

## Module Structure

The framework consists of 13 production modules. See the [Module Reference](/framework/modules) for complete documentation of each module's responsibilities and interfaces.
